## PVPGear ##

PVPGear is a plugin for Bukkit Minecraft Server that makes some items like golden armor and tools (useless before) useful again – in PVP!

Items are fully configurable through config so you can make any item to hit foes like thousand swords (or harder!).

Also, there is a parameter that can make your items to set your foes on fire!

You can also make certain enchantments do additional damage or even ignite opponents!

Current plugin state: beta. I haven't throughly tested this on productions server so use at your own risk.

Configuration is explained on [our GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/toxuin/PVPGear/wiki/Файл-конфигурации) ([also a russian / русская версия](https://github.com/toxuin/PVPGear/wiki/Файл-конфигурации))
